            Risk modleing and shift from Hadoop to Hybrid Cluster
            <br><br>
            The shift from a centralized HDFS data lake to a distributed hybrid architecture introduces significant risk to data lineage, a key component of model validation. 
            In a Hortonworks environment, data lineage is  managed within a contained ecosystem using tools Apache Atlas. 
            In the new architecture, a model's feature engineering pipeline may source data from on-premise systems, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets, and Google BigQuery tables simultaneously. 
            This fragmentation creates multiple points of failure for lineage tracking. 
            A critical MRM control is to implement a unified data governance fabric, GCP Dataplex, to catalog and trace data assets across the hybrid environment, 
            ensuring that the exact state and transformation logic of the data used for model training and execution can be reproduced for validation and regulatory audit, as required by regulations like SR 11-7.
            <br><br>
            Principle of MRM is ensuring that a model is reproducible. 
            While the monolithic nature of a shared Hadoop cluster presented challenges, the move to OpenShift introduces both mitigants and new risks. 
            The use of containerization (via Docker) and declarative YAML manifests for deployments drastically improves the technical reproducibility of a model's runtime environment. 
            However, this shifts the risk to the container image lifecycle. 
            The MRM framework must now incorporate controls for versioning Dockerfiles, scanning base images for vulnerabilities using GCP Container Analysis, and managing a private, immutable image repository (Artifact Registry). 
            Without these controls, differences in library versions or environment variables between development, validation, and production containers can lead to non-reproducible model outputs and significant validation failures.
            <br><br>
            In the Hortonworks ecosystem, access to models and data was typically governed by perimeter security and internal controls like Apache Ranger policies. 
            Migrating to a hybrid cloud model fundamentally changes the security risk by exposing models as microservices via APIs, managed through OpenShift Routes or GCP Cloud Endpoints. 
            This introduces new risk vectors such as insecure API configurations, authentication/authorization failures, and network traversal vulnerabilities. 
            A modern MRM framework must mandate a Zero Trust security model, requiring robust identity and access management (GCP IAM), strong authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0/OIDC), 
            and network policies enforced by a service mesh like Istio to control both north-south and east-west traffic. 
            The risk is the potential for model manipulation or denial-of-service attacks through its API endpoints.
            <br><br>
            The performance characteristics of risk models, particularly those used for real-time scoring or pricing, are considered part of their function. 
            The distributed nature of the hybrid environment introduces significant performance volatility risk. 
            A model executing on an OpenShift pod may experience unpredictable network latency when fetching data from an on-premise source via a Google Cloud Interconnect. 
            This latency can cause model execution to breach its Service Level Agreement (SLA), rendering it ineffective for its business purpose. 
            MRM must expand its scope to include rigorous performance testing that simulates these cross-environment data flows, re-benchmarking model execution times and establishing new monitoring through tools 
            like GCP Cloud Monitoring and Prometheus to detect performance degradation that could materially impact business decisions.
            <br><br>
            Auditing a traditional Hadoop environment often involved manual inspection of configuration files, access logs, and job histories. 
            The shift to an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and declarative model with OpenShift and GCP transforms this process. 
            The primary source of truth for a model's environment and deployment configuration now resides in version-controlled repositories (e.g., Git) as Kubernetes YAML and Terraform files. 
            The risk is that a subtle misconfiguration in a manifest could lead to a major compliance breach. 
            The new MRM control becomes the implementation of a GitOps workflow, where every change to a model's production state is auditable, peer-reviewed, and automatically applied. 
            This provides regulators and auditors with a complete, immutable log of changes, shifting the focus from manual server inspection to validating the integrity and 
            security of the CI/CD pipeline and the declarative configurations themselves.
