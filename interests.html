    <h1>Topics of Interest</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Generative AI & Large Language Models</h2>
        <p>
            Placeholder to write experience with the H200 GPU cluster.
        </p>
        <h3>Analogy for GPUDirect</h3>
        <p>
    To understand how GPUDirect works, think of your computer's components like an office. Normally, data has to take a winding path from storage (the "Mailroom") to the CPU (the "Secretary") before finally reaching the GPU (the "Graphics Department"). This creates a bottleneck. GPUDirect acts like an express elevator, allowing data to bypass the CPU and travel directly from storage to the GPU, dramatically speeding up the process.
